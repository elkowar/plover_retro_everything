# Plover Retro EVERYTHING

Surround words you previously typed with arbitrary translations, 
allowing you to turn most mode-switching plugin into a retro-plugin!

## Usage

Add dictionary entries like these:

```json
"KARPS": "=retro_everything:{MODE:CAPS},{MODE:RESET}",
"*UPBDZ": "=retro_everything:{MODE:SET_SPACE:_},{MODE:RESET}"
```
and that's it!
